GeneralizedLinearMixedModel is currently unsupported. use_threads determines whether or not to use thread-based parallelism.\n\nNote that use_threads=true may not offer a performance boost and may even decrease peformance if multithreaded linear algebra (BLAS) routines are available. In this case, threads at the level of the linear algebra may already occupy all processors/processor cores. There are plans to provide better support in coordinating Julia- and BLAS-level threads in the future.\n\nMethod\n\nThe method implemented here is based on the approach given in Section 3.2 of: Carpenter, J.R., Goldstein, H. and Rasbash, J.

At the observational level, this is resampling of the residuals, i.e. comparable to the step in the classical nonparametric bootstrap for OLS regression. At the group level, samples are done jointly for all  terms (\"random intercept and random slopes\", conditional modes) associated with a particular level of a blocking factor. For example, the predicted slope and intercept for a single participant or item are kept together. This clumping in the resampling procedure is necessary to preserve the original correlation structure of the slopes and intercepts.\n\nIn addition to this resampling step, there is also an inflation step. Due to the shrinkage associated with the random effects in a mixed model, the variance of the conditional modes / BLUPs / random intercepts and slopes is less than the variance estimated by the model and displayed in the model summary or via MixedModels.VarCorr. This shrinkage also impacts the observational level residuals. To compensate for this, the resampled residuals and groups are scale-inflated so that their standard deviation matches that of the estimates in the original model.\n\nSee also nonparametricbootstrap and MixedModels.simulate!.\n\nReference\n\nThe method implemented here is based on the approach given in Section 3.2 of: Carpenter, J.R., Goldstein, H. and Rasbash, J.
